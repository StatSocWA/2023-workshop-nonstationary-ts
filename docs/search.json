    "text": "Abstract\nThis workshop covers the modelling and analysis of (second-order) nonstationary time series. That is, time series whose second-order properties (variance, autocovariance) can change over time. We will look at some models for nonstationary time series and study their controlling parameters. We will then examine methods for estimating those parameters and statistical tests that can be used to detect non-stationarity in such time series.\nIn the second part we will look at methods for estimating local versions of the classical autocovariance and partial autocovariance, which can provide a lot of insight into the behaviour of the series over time.\nFinally, we will examine methods and software for forecasting such series and seeing how they compare to methods designed for stationary series. If time permits, we might examine some network time series models."
